  return `You are setting up Minilytics analytics + revenue attribution in this codebase. Minilytics is my self-hosted analytics (like DataFast / Plausible). Do the work directly in the code. Only ask me questions about things you cannot find out by reading the codebase, and ask them all together, up front, before making changes.

## My Minilytics values (already correct — use them as-is)
- Dashboard / API host: ${origin}
- Website ID: ${site.id}
- Tracked domain: ${site.domain} (all subdomains such as app.${site.domain} count as the same site)
- Revenue currency: ${site.currency}
- Script tag:
  ${script}

## Task 1 — Install the tracking script on every page
- Find how this project renders the HTML <head> (e.g. Next.js app/layout.tsx or pages/_document.tsx, Vite/CRA index.html, Astro/Nuxt/SvelteKit/Remix root layout, plain HTML files, WordPress header.php…) and add the script tag so it loads on EVERY page, including the logged-in app and any subdomains that live in this repo.
- Next.js: use next/script: <Script defer data-website-id="${site.id}" src="${origin}/js/script.js" strategy="afterInteractive" />
- Keep the exact attributes. Load it once only. Single-page-app navigation is tracked automatically; do not add manual pageview calls.
- If the project has a Content-Security-Policy, allow ${origin} in script-src and connect-src.

## Task 2 — Revenue attribution with Dodo Payments and/or Polar
The script stores two first-party cookies: \`ml_vid\` (visitor id) and \`ml_sid\` (session id). Every payment must carry them as metadata so Minilytics knows which visitor (and therefore which tweet / article / Google page) made the money. Do this for whichever provider this codebase uses (it may use both).

### Dodo Payments
- Search the codebase for Dodo usage: "dodopayments", "DodoPayments", "checkoutSessions.create", "payments.create", "subscriptions.create", "checkout.dodopayments.com", "/buy/".
- Where a checkout/payment/subscription is created on the SERVER, read the cookies from the incoming request and MERGE them into the existing metadata (never drop existing metadata keys):
    metadata: { ...existingMetadata, ml_visitor_id: <cookie ml_vid> ?? '', ml_session_id: <cookie ml_sid> ?? '' }
  Next.js App Router example: const jar = await cookies(); jar.get('ml_vid')?.value
- If the checkout request is made from the BROWSER to the server (fetch/axios), it normally already sends cookies on the same domain. If the API is on a different domain, read the ids in the browser with window.minilytics.attribution() (returns { ml_visitor_id, ml_session_id }) and send them in the request body, then put them in metadata on the server.
- Static Dodo payment links (<a href="https://checkout.dodopayments.com/buy/...">) need no change — the script adds metadata to them automatically on click. But if code redirects to a payment link with JavaScript (window.location = ...), append the params yourself: ?metadata_ml_visitor_id=<id>&metadata_ml_session_id=<id> using window.minilytics.attribution().
- Make sure every checkout has a return/redirect URL on this site (e.g. return_url: 'https://${site.domain}/thanks' for checkout sessions, or ?redirect_url=... on payment links), and that page loads the Minilytics script. Dodo appends ?payment_id=... (or ?subscription_id=...) to it, and Minilytics uses that to link the payment to the visitor even if metadata is lost. Keep those query params on the URL (don't strip them before the page loads).
- Do NOT touch Dodo webhooks in this codebase for Minilytics. I connect Dodo → Minilytics myself in the Dodo dashboard (webhook URL: ${origin}/api/webhooks/dodo/${site.id}).

### Polar (polar.sh)
- Search the codebase for Polar usage: "@polar-sh/sdk", "polar-sh", "Polar", "checkouts.create", "checkout_id", "buy.polar.sh", "polar_cl_", "polar_c_", "customer_metadata", "success_url" / "successUrl".
- Where a Polar checkout is created on the SERVER, read the cookies from the incoming request and MERGE them into BOTH metadata and customer_metadata (never drop existing keys). Polar copies checkout metadata onto the order and customer_metadata onto the customer:
    metadata: { ...existingMetadata, ml_visitor_id: <cookie ml_vid> ?? '', ml_session_id: <cookie ml_sid> ?? '' }
    customer_metadata: { ...existingCustomerMetadata, ml_visitor_id: <cookie ml_vid> ?? '', ml_session_id: <cookie ml_sid> ?? '' }
- If the checkout request is made from the BROWSER to the server, cookies usually go along. If the API is on a different domain, read window.minilytics.attribution() and send those ids, then put them in metadata / customer_metadata on the server.
- Static Polar checkout links (<a href="https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_...">) need no change — the script sets reference_id to the visitor id automatically (Polar checkout links only persist reference_id and UTM query params as metadata, not arbitrary keys). If code redirects to a Polar checkout link with JavaScript, append ?reference_id=<ml_visitor_id> yourself using window.minilytics.attribution(), but do not overwrite an existing reference_id.
- Make sure every Polar checkout has a success URL on this site that loads the Minilytics script, with Polar's checkout id placeholder, e.g. success_url: 'https://${site.domain}/checkout/complete?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}'. Polar substitutes the real checkout session id. Keep checkout_id on the URL (don't strip it before the page loads) — Minilytics uses it to link the payment if metadata is missing.
- Do NOT touch Polar webhooks in this codebase for Minilytics. I connect Polar → Minilytics myself in the Polar dashboard (webhook URL: ${origin}/api/webhooks/polar/${site.id}; events: order.paid, refund.created, refund.updated).

## Task 3 — Identify logged-in users
Right after a successful login/signup (and on app load when a user session exists), call:
  window.minilytics?.('identify', { user_id: user.id, email: user.email, name: user.name })
This links anonymous visits to the person, and is a fallback for attributing payments by email.

## Task 4 — Track key buttons as goals
Add data attributes to the most important calls-to-action (no JS needed), using short snake_case names:
  <button data-ml-goal="signup_click">  ·  data-ml-goal="start_trial"  ·  data-ml-goal="pricing_cta"  ·  data-ml-goal="checkout_click"
Optional details: data-ml-goal-plan="pro". From code: window.minilytics?.('goal', 'signup_completed', { plan: 'pro' }).
Track at least: the main signup/get-started button(s), pricing-page plan buttons, and the checkout/buy button. Also fire window.minilytics?.('goal', 'signup_completed') after a successful signup.

## TypeScript
If the project uses TypeScript, add a global declaration so calls type-check:
  declare global { interface Window { minilytics?: ((cmd: 'goal' | 'identify' | 'pageview', a?: any, b?: any) => void) & { attribution?: () => { ml_visitor_id?: string; ml_session_id?: string } } } }
Always call it with optional chaining (window.minilytics?.(...)) so pages never break if the script is blocked.

## Rules
- Make minimal, focused changes that match the existing code style. Don't refactor unrelated code.
- Don't hardcode secrets. None are needed for this setup.
- The script ignores localhost by default. To test locally add data-allow-localhost to the script tag temporarily (remove it before committing), or test on the deployed site.

## When you are done, reply with
1. A list of every file you changed and why.
2. Which checkout/payment code paths now send ml_visitor_id / ml_session_id (Dodo and/or Polar), and any you could not find or were unsure about.
3. Which goals you added and where.
4. How I can verify: open the site, in DevTools → Network a POST to ${origin}/api/event returns 202, and the visit appears in my Minilytics dashboard within seconds.`;
